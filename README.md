# Legacy R repo

During my undergraduate studies we had classes in statistics and econometrics.  

Of course, when I was writing this code in R, I had no idea that GitHub even existed, so I didn't manage to save all the files, but recently I accidentally opened RStudio and saw that some files are still available, so I decided to save them in my GitHub repository.  

Don't judge harshly, we were taught Statistics and Econometrics rather than programming, but this code brings back fond memories for me.
